									I am a nutritionst seeking mutual referrals with NDs. I address this a little more at the end...
									As a primary care provider, do you make recommendations to your patients in reference to dietary changes, but see low compliance? For example, a therapeutic diet may help alleviate their symptoms. However, for many, dietary changes are not easy. Many people KNOW that they should be eating differently, but follow-through and commitment are problematic.
									You don't have the time to scour the nutrition and supplement research literature, develop meal plans, recipes, or shopping lists, meet with your patients for an hour every week to address their challenges and successes, nor go to their home and help them clear out their pantry, or walk with them through the grocery store, teaching them to read labels, and which products are better choices.
									That is the job of the nutritionist. The nutritionist becomes the patients'/clients' accountability partner. As a result, compliance is affected, and symptoms abate. The time that I spend with my nutrition counseling clients allows me to gain insight into their goals and learn what motivates them, as well as factors that may be barriers to their success, such as family, social, and economic. Providing a caring and attentive presence, I learn their likes and dislikes, and devise meal plans and other recommendations accordingly.
									I am looking for NDs who think they may benefit from having a nutritionist in their referral base. Ideal referrals include patients who need guidance in shifting to a new way of eating, especially therapeutic diets; who lack confidence in planning meals and snacks for themselves and their families, developing shopping lists, and cooking; who dislike grocery shopping, and are overwhelmed by the overload of conflicting information around diet and nutrition from friends, family, and the media.<br>
									If you think that having a nutritionist in your referral base might benefit your goals for your patients, please contact me for a one-on-one meeting, so that we might better understand where our practices can complement one another.<br>
									Ideally, I am seeking practitioners with a focus on or have an appreciation for women's and queer health, as well as mental and emotional health, and compassionate care, in general. My goal is for our referrals to be mutual! I have a strong desire to connect with like-minded NDs to refer my clients to.
